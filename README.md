Vrinda store sales data

Hello All,

I am very excited to share the Vrinda store sales analysis report for your attention.

Objectives:

Vrinda store wants to create an annual sales report for 2022 so that Vrinda can understand their customers and grow more sales in 2023.

To improve sales and the customer base in 2023, we need to find the following KPIs and reports:

-Compare the sales and orders using a single chart.
-Which month had the highest sales and orders?
-Who purchased more - men or women in 2022?
-What are the different order statuses in 2022?
-List the top 10 states contributing to the sales.
-The relationship between age and gender based on the number of orders.
-Which channel is contributing to the maximum sales?
-The highest selling category, etc.

What we did to find the above data from the given raw data:

-Data cleaning, analysis, and filtering.
-We implemented some basic formulas like "if," etc.
-We created pivot tables to generate charts for the dashboard.
-we inserted slicers and connected them to each chart.
-Finally, we generated insights to improve sales in 2023.

Insights Report Sales in 2023:

-The highest sales occurred in the month of March, with a total of 2,819 orders received.
-Women are the primary contributors, accounting for 64% of the total sales, while men contribute only 36%.
-Maharashtra leads in sales with 2.99 million, followed closely by Karnataka with 2.65 million.
-We achieved our highest sales and profits through the Amazon marketplace, which accounts for a significant 35.48% share compared to other marketplaces.
-Our delivery success rate stands at an impressive 92.25%.
-Middle-aged customers, aged 31 to 50, are the largest contributors. Among them, women make up 33.32% of the customer base, while men account for 14.91%.

To Improve sales in 2023:

-Our main target audience is women for sales. We need to run more ads, primarily in Maharashtra, followed by Karnataka. Additionally, we should provide discounts or offers to improve sales for men.

-We should focus on the months of October, November, and December. The reason is that during these months, we have major festivals like Diwali, Christmas, and New Year. According to our report, we experience very low sales during this period.

-Our focus should be on the adult category, particularly the 18-30 age group. We should include trendy dresses for college-going individuals and office workers.
